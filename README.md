I am a software developer with a passion for data science and full-stack web development. With several years of experience in building data-driven products, I have acquired a deep understanding of how to create robust and scalable software solutions that solve business problems. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality, user-friendly software solutions to real-world problems; my open-source software packages have been downloaded over 40 million times.  Additionally, I have 10+ years of experience in using data science tools to draw insights from complex experimental datasets.  My skills include statistical modelling, experimental design, data analysis, visualization, and communication. I have 20+ peer-reviewed publications with 8000+ citations and 2 online books.

## Software development

I have authored over a dozen R packages that deal with:

- statistical analysis and reporting (e.g. [*easystats*](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/) project, a collection of 10 packages)
- data visualization (e.g. [*ggstatsplot*](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot): Enhancing `{ggplot2}` plots with statistical analysis)
- code analysis ([*lintr*](https://lintr.r-lib.org/): Static code analysis for R)
- code formatting ([*styler*](https://styler.r-lib.org/): Non-invasive pretty-printing of R code)

<!-- - interactive web applications -->

Other authored packages include:

*datawizard*, *performance*, *parameters*, *insight*, *effectsize*, *bayestestR*, *modelbased*,
*ggsignif*, *see*, *statsExpressions*, *report*, *correlation*, *styler*, *ospsuite*, *ospsuite.utils*, *esqlabsR*
