I am a seasoned senior software engineer with extensive experience across multiple domains (energy, pharma, research) and comprehensive expertise in diverse software architectures (full-stack web, data science, enterprise systems). With 10+ years of progressive development leadership, I architect and deliver software solutions that drive business value and technical excellence.
